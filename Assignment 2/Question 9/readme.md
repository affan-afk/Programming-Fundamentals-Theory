how I solved this problem:
basically mene switch case use kar k aik menu banaya using the W,A,S,D as the condition.
phir mene check kiya k player X ya Y co ordinates out of grid to nahi jaarahay, i also checked if the the respective move to the cell doesn't contain 'X' yaani if player can move to the grid. Agar valid cell main move krskta hai to mene check kiya k uss cell main 'I' hai ya nhin,agar 'I' hai to player uss cell main move kr jaaeyega aur items collected increment hojaayega.
